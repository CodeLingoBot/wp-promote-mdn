How It Works
------------

The plugin automatically links keywords and phrases in WordPress posts and
pages to pages on MDN. The keywords/phrases are loaded once per day from [a
special page on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Template:Promote-MDN?raw=1)

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the repo into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Make changes

Running Tests
-------------

Yes, I actually wrote tests for a WordPress Plugin. Don't judge me. To run
them, simply run::

    phpunit
